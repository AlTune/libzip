------------------------------------------------ showstopper
* API cleanup
	check function names (consistency, appropriateness)
	error handling: errno member in struct zip, struct zip_file
	error handling in zip_open?
	error string: in user buffer, malloced, or in struct zip{,_file}
	file sizes, offsets: type big enough?
	meta data: expose struct vs. accessor functions
	don't expose struct zip, struct zip_file
* needed functions:
	get status of struct zip_file (member flags)
	get error code from struct zip
	get nentries from zip
	convert error codes to string
* documentation: zip_add*, zip_replace*, [zip_free_meta, zip_meta_new]
* correct version in installed libzip.so.x.y
* regression tests
* code review

------------------------------------------------ others
* fix warnings in zipcmp
* zipcmp: add option for file content comparison
* zipcmp: add option for case insensitive name comparison

* don't allow the same filename twice in a zip (when adding/replacing)
* append to files (for self-extracting files)
* add custom compression function support
 *zip_replace_zip: remember compression method, recompress if different speced
* better closing of zip-files
* close even if error...
* update-zip (instead of close, reopen)
* support for old compression methods?????
* zip-comment functions
* better error handling, more verbose
